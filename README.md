Packaged-Web-App-Remote-Storage-Demo
====================================

This repository contains Packageed Web App with Remote Storage integration with remoteStorage.js.

It was based in the [minimal example](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/blob/master/example/minimal-head/index.html) and [My Favourite Drinks](https://myfavoritedrinks.5apps.com/) provided at [remotestorage.io](http://remotestorage.io/).

##Deployment:

###Pre-requisites
You need to have an account on the [OST]((https://www.ost.pt) platform [set as developer](https://www.ost.pt/user/developer-settings). 

###Procedure
- edit 'config.xml' and change 'your-app-id' to an id of your choice

- zip all the files and change the extension from '.zip' to '.wgt'

- [submit a new app](https://www.ost.pt/app/new)

- check [your listing](https://www.ost.pt/apps/your-listings) for the app you just created

##How to use the app

- get a remote storage account, for instance at [heahdk.net/](https://heahdk.net/)
- log in with your account on the remoteStorage widget and your data will be stored in your remoteStorage provider


##What is remoteStorage?

	remoteStorage.js is a JavaScript library, used to enable users of unhosted web apps (JavaScript apps 
	running in a browser) to store their data at a place of their choice (their “remoteStorage” server).
	It tries to get in the way of app developers as little  as possible, while providing the easiest path for 
	both developers and users to integrate their storage with apps.
